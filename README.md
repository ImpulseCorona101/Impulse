Particular slot can only be booked by certain number of peoples (Ensuring social distancing).

## Farmer-Buyer Based Ecommerce Website

lack of food supply,To bridge this gap we have come up with solution named AgroCraft an ecommerce platform 
for farmers to sell their products at better rate , and buyers (vendors,organization) can get directly in 
touch with these local farmers to fulfill society needs .Keeping in mind the digital divide , Farmers can
upload their products via SMS and CALL (customer care).Also the Buyer can even chat with farmer for negotiation
and obtaining other information .
